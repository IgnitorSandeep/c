Extern Keyword
**************

1.
**

extern int var;

It means varible is declare but not defined mean memory is not allocated to the var.

var = 10;

So if you will try to change the value of the var then it will give compile time error.
But in this case suppose there is a c/h file that defines a variable var.it can be run by include it.

2.
**

But once you write extern as

extern int var=10;

It means it is declared and defined also.
